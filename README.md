## What is UI5

Client-side JavaScript library for creating Web user interfaces its all run inside your browswer using java script code.

## Why SAPUI5

#### A set of around 500 controls of button, input text to complex component such as Tables or even 3D controls like Table. 
#### Consistent user experience, common design language. 
#### Enterprise ready- Very robust, well tested support for internationalization, translation extensiblity, security, responsive (based on the user size)

## Key Learning

#### This repository will introduce you to the responsive UI library that SAP uses to create web apps. In this [course](https://open.sap.com/courses/ui51) we will start with a simple “Hello World” example and then we will add more feature to our apps.

#### You’ll learn about the main development concepts of SAPUI5. We’ll add many layout and UI controls and introduce the Model View Controller (MVC) concept to our app.

#### We’ll structure our application project with the application descriptor and a component. And we’ll introduce essential features to create enterprise-grade apps such as data binding and internationalization.

#### The second section (commit 9-12) is more focused on the data binding and connection of our app to a real back-end service
